George Zipperlen's home page

- A sandbox to play with HTML, DOM, and CSS. 
  No JavaScript.  Too many languages in my toolkit, need to concentrate on Python.

  - Use GitHub's Jekyll framework, but make it possible to publish my own HTML and CSS anywhere.

- A repository for my resumÃ« and profile bios
  - high level structure in DOM
  - individual pieces in MarkDown
    - job history
    - major projects
    - education
    
    - assemble into .html for display 
    - assemble into .doc for printing and distribution.

  - This will structure the resume in one repository, and make it much easier to maintain.  
    The individual pieces can be used for Profile pages on StackOverflow, LinkedIn, etc.

- Never have to use Word ever again! (OK, that might be too optimistic)
